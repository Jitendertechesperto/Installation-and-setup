-----------How To Secure Apache with Let's Encrypt on Ubuntu 22.04------------

Step 1 — Installing Certbot
  
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache
   (You will be prompted to confirm the installation by pressing Y, then ENTER)
   


Step 2 — Checking your Apache Virtual Host Configuration

   sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/your_domain.conf
          (ServerName your_domain)
          (ServerAlias www.your_domain)
   sudo apache2ctl configtest
   sudo systemctl reload apache2



Step 3 — Allowing HTTPS Through the Firewall

   sudo ufw status

    Output
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere                  
Apache                     ALLOW       Anywhere             
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)             
Apache (v6)                ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)

sudo ufw allow 'Apache Full'
sudo ufw delete allow 'Apache'
sudo ufw status

Output
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere                  
Apache Full                ALLOW       Anywhere                  
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)             
Apache Full (v6)           ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)        





Step 4 — Obtaining an SSL Certificate

    sudo certbot --apache

This certificate expires on 2022-07-10.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.
Certbot has set up a scheduled task to automatically renew this certificate in the background.

Deploying certificate
