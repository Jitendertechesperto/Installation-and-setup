---------------------------------------Restrict User SFTP Access-----------------------------------
sudo apt install openssh-server
First we will make a group for sftp in which we will add those user who want to access only provided directory

Sudo groupadd groupname

sudo useradd -g groupname -s /bin/false -m -d /home/username username 
  (in this command we are making a user and adding this user in the group )
  (-g is for adding in group, -s for restriction in binary, -m for creating a dir, -d for specify a dir for the installation process)

sudo passwd username  (assigning password to user)

exceptional - sudo usermod -G sftp -s /bin/false /username 
 (this command is for if, the user is already exist and we just have to add that user in the group)

sudo chown root: /home/username (change home dir ownership from user to root)
sudo chmod 755 /home/username (change home dir permission)

sudo mkdir /home/username/{public-html,uploads}
(so this is the kind of exceptional because public html and upload are those folder in which we are giving access to useronly)
(here we are making 2 folder in if its already exist we dont have to make it)
(we use curly brasis beacuse the folder is more than 1 other wise normal brasis will be used)

sudo chmod 755 /home/username/{public-html,uploads}

sudo chown username:groupname /home/username/{public-html,uploads} 
(this command is for giving access tp user who is the group both the folder)

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
find this line (subsystem sftp  /user/lib/openssh/sftp-server)
(after finding this line add this line)  
match group sftp                  (Group name which we are looking for restriction)
ChrootDirectory %h                (access should be at home)
ForceCommand internal-sftp        
AllowTcpForwardingg no
XLLForwarding no
                 ctrl plus x 
                    yes
sudo systemctl restart ssh
ifconfig (ip identify)
go to file zilla
